Question 1
First of all, download the sources for this lab, compile and execute the program testVersion. Is the stability test (w.r.t. minor version numbers) correct?
--Yes

Question 2
The computation to find the minor version is syntactically valid and looks correct. With the help of a debugger, explain why the program produces this output.
--Which computation?

Question 3
Using the name of the structure members, fix the is_unstable() function.
-- return 1 & ((char*)&v->minor)[0] instead of return 1 & ((char *)v)[sizeof(unsigned long)];
-- Padding (alignment) fÃ¼hrt dazu, dass die Adresse von minor nicht bei sizeof(unsigned long) liegt.

Question 4
What is the memory footprint of struct version? Is it optimal?
--No, we can change the order minor -> major -> flags
